# 1. Introduction 
Buying a used car you need to consider various factors. This study aims to better understand how mileage influences the cost of a used car. The average cost of a used car in the UK in 2020 is 23471.45 Euros. This project investigates whether factors such as the mileage of a car and transmission type of a car are related to used car costs in the UK. 

To address this question, we used the^[KUKUROO3 _used car price dataset (competition format)_. Kaggle, n.d. Web. 19 Nov 2022. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kukuroo3/used-car-price-dataset-competition-format] data set from Kaggle that merged information from^[Aditya _100,000 UK Used Car Data set_. Kaggle, n.d. Web. 19 Nov 2022. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes?select=vw.csv] which contains cars listed for sale from various used car listing websites.  The data was last updated two years ago. Each case in the data set is a used car for sale in the UK. The data from Kaggle had data divided into two separate CSVs, so a script was ran to concatenate them called merger.py accessible from the term_project repository^[HauntingRex9763 _term_project_. GitHub, September, 2022. Web. 19 Nov 2022. https://github.com/HauntingRex9763/term_project]. 

It was decided to have price of used cars for sale in the UK (in Euros) as our outcome variable. There is two explanatory variables in this analysis: the mileage of a car, and transmission type of a car, with three levels, "Automatic", "Semi-Auto", and "Manual". The 'Other' category was omittted as it had an irrelevant count of items (1).

Here is a snapshot of 5 randomly chosen rows of the data set we'll use:

```{r}
df %>% 
  sample_n(5)
```

# 2. Exploratory data analysis
We had an original sample size of 4960 graduates however since the category 'other' for transmission type was small in comparison of the other categories it was omitted and the new length is 4959.

The total sample size is 4959. (Table 1). The mean of the used car price was greatest for cars who with a Semi-Auto transmission (n = 1351, $\bar{x}$ = 33351.82, sd = 17674.669), second was for Automatic cars (n = 1660, $\bar{x}$ = 27466.15, sd = 16889.362), lastly was for Manual transmissions (n = 1948, $\bar{x}$ = 13214.99, sd = 6270.332), 

The cost of used cars ranged from 450 to 145000 ($\bar{x}$ = 23471.45, sd = 16408.03). 

```{r include = F}
df %>% 
  summarize(min = min(mileage), 
            max = max(mileage), 
            mean = mean(mileage), 
            sd = sd(mileage))
```

Table 1. Summary statistics of average price of used cars in the UK.

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(transmission) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            correlation = cor(price, mileage),
            mean = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE), 
            median = median(price, na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd = sd(price, na.rm = TRUE),
            min = min(price),
            max = max(price))
```

Looking at the distribution of average used car price in Figure 1, there is some pretty heavy right skew, so a log transformation was preformed to bring the data closer to a normal distribution. Figure 2 represents the data post-log-transformation.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Distribution of used car prices in the UK represented with a log transformation.", fig.align = "center"}
# Display price visualization
ggplot(data=df, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Price", y = "Frequency") 
```
```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 2. Distribution of the log of used car prices in the UK represented with a log transformation.", fig.align = "center"}
# Execute log transformation of price
df <- df %>%
  mutate(log_price =log(price))

# Display price visualization
ggplot(data=df, aes(x = log_price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "log(Price)", y = "Frequency") 
```

In Figure 3, a scatterplot was generated to see the overall relationship between our numerical outcome variable: price (price), and our numerical explanatory variable: the mileage of a used car (mileage). As the mileage of a car increased, there was an associated decrease in price for the used cars. Consistent with this relationship is the negetive correlation coefficient of -0.4788324 (a -0.6001203 correlation coefficient with the log price). 

```{r include = F}
df %>%  
  summarize(cor(price, mileage))

df %>%  
  summarize(cor(log_price, mileage))

# No extreame outliers detected
sort(df$mileage, decreasing=TRUE)
```
```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 3. Scatterplot of relationship between price and the associated mileage of cars in the UK.", fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(df, aes(x = mileage, y = price))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE ) +
  labs(y = "Price", x = "Mileage")
```

Looking at Figure 4, which displays the relationship between our numerical outcome variable price and our categorical explanatory variable transmission, the prices look to be the greatest for Semi-Auto cars, and the lowest for Manual cars. Furthermore, there appear to be some potential outlines. In particular, there is one car with a very high mileage. Semi-Auto transmissions also have the largest variation in prices as evidenced by the largest interquartile range.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 4. Boxplot of relationship between price and transmission for used cars in the UK", fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(df, aes(x = transmission, y = price, fill = transmission)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Price of used cars in the UK", x = "Transmission Type")
```

Finally, we generated a colored scatterplot displaying the relationship between all three variables at once in Figure 5.  While this plot corresponds to an interaction model where we allow for each regression line corresponding to each transmission type to have a different slope, we observe that the slopes appear to be fairly similar, and thus the regression lines are roughly parallel. The additional complexity of the interaction model model thus appears to not be warranted, and thus we will favor the simpler "parallel slopes" model in our regression analysis.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 4. Colored scatterplot of relationship between price and both mileage and transmission types of cars in the UK.", fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(df, aes(x = mileage, y = log_price, color = transmission)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE ) +
  labs(y = "Price", x = "Mileage")
```

# 3. Multiple linear regression

## 3.1 Methods

The components of our multiple linear regression model are the following:

* Outcome variable $y$ = price
* Numerical explanatory variable $x_1$ = mileage
* Categorical explanatory variable $x_2$ = transmission

where the unit of analysis is used cars for sale, given that each row in our dataset corresponds to a unique car. As discussed earlier, we did not include an interaction effect because the slopes appear to be reasonably parallel in Figure 4. 

## 3.2 Model Results

```{r}
math_model <- lm(price ~ mileage + transmission, data = df)
#math_model
get_regression_table(math_model)
```

***

## 3.3 Interpreting the regression table

The regression equation for used car prices is the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}\widehat {price} =& b_{0} + b_{mileage} \cdot mileage + b_{manual} \cdot 1_{is\ manual}(x_2) + b_{semi-auto} \cdot 1_{is\ semi-auto}(x_2) \\
 =& 34431.667 - 0.266 \cdot mileage - 13279.339 \cdot 1_{is\ manual}(x_2) + 3272.719 \cdot 1_{is\ semi-auto}(x_2)
\end{aligned} 
$$

* The intercept ($b_0$ = 34431.667) represents the average price when mileage is 0 transmission is automatic. (Table 2).
* The estimate for the slope for the price ($b_{mileage}$ = -0.266) is the associated change in mileage depending on the transmission type fo the car. Based on this estimate, for every mile traveled, there was an associated decrease in price of on average 0.266 Euros
* The estimate for Manual ($b_{manual}$ = -13279.339) and Semi-Auto ($b_{semi-auto}$ = 3272.719) are the offsets in intercept relative to the baseline group's, Automatic, intercept (Table 2). In other words, on average used cars with Manual transmissions cost 13279.339 Euros less than cars with Automatic transmissions, while used cars with Semi-Auto transmissions cost on average 3272.719 more than used cars with Automatic Transmissions.

Thus the three regression lines have equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Automatic transmissions (in red)}: \widehat {price} =& 34431.667 - 0.266 \cdot mileage\\
\text{Manual transmissions (in green)}: \widehat {price} =& 21152.328 - 0.266 \cdot mileage\\
\text{Semi-Auto transmissions (in blue)}: \widehat {price} =& 37704.386 - 0.266 \cdot mileage
\end{aligned} 
$$

## 3.4 Inference for multiple regression
Using the output of our regression table we’ll test two different null hypotheses. The first null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between the mileage of a car and price at the population level (the population slope is zero).

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text H_{0} :& \beta_{mileage} = 0\\
\text vs\ H_{a} :& \beta_{mileage} ≠ 0\\
\end{aligned} 
$$

There appears to be a negative relationship between the mileage of a car and the price of a used car β_{mileage} = -0.266 Furthermore, this appears to be a meaningful relationship since in Table 2 we see:

  \cdot the 95% confidence interval for the population slope β_mileage is (-0.280, -0.251), entirely on the negative side
  
  \cdot the p-value p<0.001 is rather small, so we reject the null hypothesis H0 that β_{mileage}=0 in favor of the alternative H_a that β_{mileage} is indeed not 0 and in fact negative.

So taking into account potential sampling variation in results the relationship does appear to be negative.
  
The second set of null hypotheses that we are test are that all the differences in intercept for the non-baseline groups (manual, and semi-auto transmissions) are zero.
  
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text H_{0} :& \beta_{manual} = 0\\
\text vs\ H_{a} :& \beta_{manual} ≠ 0\\
\end{aligned} 
$$
and
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text H_{0} :& \beta_{semi-auto} = 0\\
\text vs\ H_{a} :& \beta_{semi-auto} ≠ 0\\
\end{aligned} 
$$

In other words “is the intercept for the automatic transmissions equal to the intercepts for the manual transmissions or not?” As well as “is the intercept for the automatic transmissions equal to the intercepts for the semi-auto transmissions or not?” While the manual transmission's observed difference was negative, semi-auto transmissions had a positive observed difference in intercept.

(β_{manual} = -13279.339 and β_{semi-auto} = 3272.719) we observe in Table 2 that:


  \cdot the 95% confidence intervals for the population difference in intercept β_{manual} and β_{semi_auto} both do not include 0: (-14098.824, -12459.853) and (2364.289, 4181.150) respectively. This means that the differences between the slopes cannot be 0, hence it is impossible that all intercepts are the same.
  
  \cdot The respective p-values are both p<0.001 is rather small, so we reject the null hypothesis for H_0 that β_{manual}=0, and β_{semi-auto}=0 in favor of the alternative H_a that β_{manual} is indeed not 0 and negative, and β_{semi-auto} is indeed not zero, and negative.

  So it appears the differences in intercept are meaningfully different from 0, and hence all three intercepts are not equal. This is consistent with our observations from the visualization of the three regression lines in Figure 4.


## 3.5 Residual Analysis
We conducted a residual analysis to see if there was any systematic pattern of residuals for the statistical model we ran. Because if there are systematic patterns, then we cannot fully trust our confidence intervals and p-values above.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 5. Histogram of residuals for statistical model.", fig.align = "center"}
residuals <- rstandard(math_model)
df <- cbind(df, residuals)

ggplot(df, aes(x=residuals)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 6. Scatterplots of residuals against the numeric explanatory variable.", fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(df, aes(x=mileage, y=residuals)) +
  geom_jitter()  +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE )
```
```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 7. Scatterplots of residuals against the fitted values.", fig.align = "center"}
fit <- fitted(math_model)
ggplot(df, aes(x=fit, y=residuals)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE )
```
```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 8. Boxplot of residuals for each level of the categorical explanatory variable.", fig.align = "center"}
 coefs <- coef(lm(residuals ~ transmission, data = df))
ggplot(df, aes(x=transmission, y=residuals)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_abline(intercept = coefs[1], slope = coefs[2])
```

The model residuals were normally distributed, though there was one potential outlier (Fig. 5). There are not any systematic patterns to either of the scatter plots (Fig 6 & 7). There is, however, some clear outliers around 15,000 in Figure 6 and at a very high mileage in Figure 7. The boxplots show a very even spread of residuals for automatic, and a semi-auto transmissions, bt the spread is much smaller for cars with manual transmissions; however the mean values for the three remain close near 0. It is concluded that the assumptions for inference in multiple linear regression are well met.

# 4. Discussion 

## 4.1 Conclusions
We found that there was significant differences in the price of used cars in the UK for diffrent types of transmissions, and that as the mileage of the car increased, the price of the used car decreased significantly. On average, the price decreased by on average 0.266 pounds for every one unit increase in the mileage of a used car. This however does not necessarily mean that mileage causes lower prices, merely that they are associated. It was surprising to find that transmission type has a significant influence on the price of a used car. This may be that manual transmissions are cheaper to produce, or there is a smaller market buying them and therefore less competition. It is more expensive to produce automatic transmissions and there is a lot more people out to buy them, this may explain the differences between the two.

Overall, these results suggest that the mileage of a car is a factor in its resell value. Our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that found mileage is correlated to the price of used cars in the UK^[Anonymous _How does mileage affect car value?_. We Buy Any Car, n.d. Web. 01 Dec 2022. https://www.webuyanycar.com/car-valuation/how-does-car-mileage-affect-value/#:~:text=A%20loose%20example%20would%20be,a%20decrease%20of%2020%25)]. In order to mitigate this, we believe that there should be more regular maintenance on cars with higher mileages, in order to keep the car in good shape as it endures more wear. This could include regular inspections and quickly addressing issues before they grow to be big issues. Furthermore, being careful to not beat the car up by driving aggressively or on rough terrains could improve the lifespan. The trends found in this analysis are important because used car prices are especially high right now given the shortage in newer vehicles coming out as various supply chain issues are ongoing partly due to the results of manufacturing slowing down in the Covid lock downs, which in our current society is often a necessity in order to get around given the overpriced, and inconsistent public transit, and the non existent options in the country side.

## 4.2 Limitations
There were a few limitations to this data set. For one, 1 out of the 4959 used cars had a 'other' transmission. Furthermore, this data is only for the UK in 2016. As such, our scope of inference is limited to the UK; and it may not be appropriate to generalize the results found to the world as a whole. 

## 4.3 Further questions
If we were to continue researching this topic, we would like to work with a data set that includes region and terrain or the region the car was driven, instead of just the mileage and transmission or the vehichle to research. This would give us a better glimpse into the factors that manipulate a used cars sale price. It would be ideal to use a data set also includes several years worth of data so that we can see if the trends shown persist from year to year. Finally, it would be interesting to incorporate other explanatory variables, particularly ones that explain the terrain or enviorment the vehichle was used in. The results from this sort of study could be used to better explain the factors that manipulate the price of a used car.

Since our results strongly suggest that mileage is correlated to the price of a used car, it would be interesting to investigate the median income of a region to the used car listing prices of that region.
